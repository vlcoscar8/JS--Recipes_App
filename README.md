The project is based on practicing the login, logout flow connecting to a deployed api in heroku created by myself. In addition I add a creation/ post data to the same api, in this case is about recipes, so it is needed to submit a form with several inputs such as ingredients, steps, difficulty etc. Once the recipe is created is posted inside a food category. So the user can view the foods categories with the recipes created by the users.

So the project is based on using a lot of fetch functions with get and post methods to create the flow explained previosly.

Stack used: Javascript vanilla & SCSS with the support of a personal api deployed on heroku. You can find the documentation of the api here:
